✅ Task 1: Mobile App Interface Design

Task Name: Mobile App Signup Flow UI/UX Design
Description:
Designed a clean, intuitive, and user-centric mobile application interface for a signup flow by applying core UI/UX principles such as:

Visual Hierarchy — Organized elements to guide user focus

Design Consistency — Ensured uniform styles throughout the interface

Accessibility — Considered legible typography, contrast, and usability

User-Centered Design — Crafted screens that prioritize user needs

This resulted in a smooth, engaging, and easy-to-use signup experience that aligns with modern mobile-first design standards.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Figma / Adobe XD – Wireframing & interface design (if applicable)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Structural and visual components (based on code files present)

Wireframes & Mockups – Visual design process

Google Fonts & Icons – UI enhancement assets

Future tasks may include prototypes, workflows, case studies, and more UI samples.

📘 README for Task 2 – Modern Web UI Component
✅ Task 2: Modern UI Component Development

Task Name: Responsive Web UI Component
Description:
In Task 2, I designed and developed a modern, responsive web UI component/module that demonstrates advanced layout techniques and optimal user experience (UX) practices.
The goal was to apply professional UI/UX standards to build a clean, interactive front-end component that works well across devices.

🎯 Task Objectives

✔ Build a visually engaging UI component using HTML, CSS & JavaScript
✔ Ensure responsive design for mobile, tablet & desktop
✔ Improve interaction through hover/focus effects and clean layout
✔ Demonstrate proper component structure and reusability
✔ Follow accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, readable text)

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

HTML5 for structure

CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, animations)

JavaScript for interactivity

Responsive design principles (media queries)

Fonts & icons from Google Fonts or FontAwesome

Optional tooling: VS Code, Live Server

🔍 Features Implemented

🔹 Responsive Layout – Switches cleanly between screen sizes
🔹 Interactive Elements – Buttons and cards with hover effects
🔹 Semantic Markup – Improves accessibility & SEO
🔹 Component Organization – Separate styles for maintainability
🔹 Optimized for performance – Lightweight & fast loading
